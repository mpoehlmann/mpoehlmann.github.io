          My name is Michael (David-Michael) Poehlmann.
          I am a PhD student at the University of California, Davis studying high energy experimental physics.
          I work with <a href="http://pantic.physics.ucdavis.edu">Prof. Emilija Pantic</a> on liquid argon-based rare event searches.
          Specifically, I specialize in simulations and data analysis for the <a href="http://darkside.lngs.infn.it">DarkSide Collaboration</a>, working towards the discovery of dark matter.

          As an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, I worked with <a href="https://www.physics.umn.edu/people/prisca.html">Prof. Prisca Cushman</a> to develop components for the active neutron veto for the <a href="https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu">SuperCDMS SNOLAB</a> detector. 
          I worked on doping plastic scintillators with gadolinium and characterized numerous sample properties.
          This work culminated in a first-authored paper.

          One of my other undergraduate research experiences was working with <a href="https://www.physics.umn.edu/people/jmmans.html">Prof. Jeremiah Mans</a>.
          I measured the event discrimination efficiency of thin plastic scintillator sheets for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05219">LDMX</a> experiment.
