        <p>
          I have helped to develop an outreach program to provide undergraduate students with an introduction to experimental high energy physics.
          The program, entitled "Nuclear Forensics: Dusting for the Fingerprints of Radioactivity," seeks to provide untapped groups with a hands-on experience to identify trace radioisotopes through Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA).
          NAA is a nuclear process used to determine the concentrations of elements in a material via neutron irradiation of a sample and measurements of the emitted gamma-rays.
          Participants perform lab activities and conduct data analysis in Python.
          The first iteration of this outreach effort was scheduled for the the spring of 2020, but was postponed due the COVID-19 pandemic.
          The code I wrote for this activity can be found

          One of the biggest hurdles for students beginning in experimental high energy physics is learning to code well.
          Furthermore, modern data science techniques are just beginning to become widely adopted within the field of physics.
          To help current and future students learn these skills, I am developing a set of

          for HEP applications of languages and toolkits including Python, C/C++, Julia, ROOT, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Geant4</span>.
